*We used the COMPOSITE design pattern* 


Quite a lot of time has passed since kebabs without flatbread appeared and started to lose
their charm... But when one door closes, there's an open window that caused a draft and made
the door shut. Meet the Vezinuvezicumperiescu family, a family of pseudo-geniuses with ideas

General rules:
Code smells to watch out for:
They want to place smart devices throughout every part of their kebab shop.
A smart device has: a name and energy consumption (expressed in kWh).
The kebab shop is quite large and is divided into multiple rooms.
Each room can have IoT devices.
Some rooms are so large that they can contain both other rooms (with smart devices) and
smart devices directly.
Each device must report the following: its identity (name) and energy consumption.
Each room must report: its identity (name) and the total energy consumption of the
devices in that room and any sub-rooms.
